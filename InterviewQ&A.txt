Front End Developer Opportunity with Aviation Client


1. Can you describe your experience using React.js for building user interfaces in the aviation sector?

In the past 2 years, I worked on the React migration team, where I converted the .net pages to react on united.com. 
Frontend is React, and used ATMOS (Own library) components used company wide.

Worked on Security features for users where they can manage there account like Forgot password, Forgot MileagePlus number, 
security questions, Sign-in features, Miles-Pooling, United Club pass,  Recent Activity, dashboard updates and 
KTN(Known Traveler Number), Accessibility guidelines features on united.com.

The new initiative worked on Miles-Pooling( points you get after traveling), TSA Precheck, Account security and management features, and Under18.



2. How have you implemented Redux for state management in large-scale React applications?

used middleware such as redux-saga to handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls, data fetching, and impure actions in a more organized and efficient way.


3. What strategies do you use to optimize performance in React applications, particularly for data-heavy aviation systems?

1. Memoization with useMemo and useCallback:  Use this hooks to memoize values and, reducing unnecessary recalculations.
2. Optimizing Renders with React.Fragment: Use it to avoid unnecessary wrapper elements that could cause additional DOM nodes.
3. Lazy loading with React.lazy: Use it to load components lazily, reducing the intial bundle size and improving intial loading performance.
4. Code splitting: Employ code splitting to divide your application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, improving initial load times.
5. Optimizing Images and Assets:  Compress and optimize images, use responsive images and leverage lazy loading for images to reduce network and rendering overhead.


4. Explain how you've used Material UI components to create consistent and responsive designs for aviation-related projects.

1. Leveraging the Grid system: Material UI's Grid component is essential for creating responsive layouts.
2. Utilizing responsive components: Many Material UI components are inherently responsive. 
For instance, I often use the Button, TextField, and Card components, which automatically adjust their appearance based on screen size.
3. Implementing breakpoints: Material UI's breakpoint system allows for fine-tuned control over component behavior at different screen sizes. 
4. Customizing themes: I create custom themes to ensure consistency in colors, typography, and spacing across the entire application.
5. Using relative units: Instead of fixed pixel values, I prefer using relative units like percentages, em, or rem for sizing and spacing.
6. Employing responsive utilities: Material UI offers utilities like the Hidden component, which I use to selectively show or hide elements based on screen size.
7. Optimizing for mobile: When designing for mobile, I focus on creating components that are easily navigable with touch interactions and readable on smaller screens.
8. Testing across devices: I regularly test the UI on various devices and screen sizes to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.


5. Describe a challenging UI problem you encountered in an aviation project and how you solved it using React and Redux.
Initially worked on Sign-in features where the account gets locked if you answer 2 questions wrong.
I need to request a backend developer unlock it. 
I have created a list of steps needed to unlock and account where it has a bunch of calls within Postman and made it simple.

6. How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design in your React applications?

key strategies:

Use responsive design frameworks: Leverage frameworks like Bootstrap, Material-UI, or Ant Design, which provide pre-built responsive components.

Implement CSS media queries: Apply specific styles based on screen size or device type to ensure your components adapt to different devices.

Utilize Flexbox and Grid layouts: These modern CSS techniques create flexible and responsive designs that work across browsers.

Employ a mobile-first approach: Design for the smallest screen size first, then progressively enhance for larger screens.

Use CSS resets and normalize styles: These techniques help create a consistent baseline across different browsers.

Avoid fixed-width elements: Instead, use minimum and maximum width properties to create flexible layouts.

Implement feature detection: Use libraries like Modernizr to check if a browser supports specific features.

Utilize cross-browser testing tools: Use platforms like BrowserStack or CrossBrowserTesting to test your application on multiple browsers and devices.

Follow web standards: Adhere to W3C standards for JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to ensure consistent behavior across browsers.

Use polyfills and shims: These scripts provide support for features in older browsers that don't natively support them.

Optimize images for different devices: Use responsive images or resize them appropriately for each device.

Implement server-side rendering: This technique can improve performance and ensure consistent rendering across different browsers.




7. Can you walk us through your process for integrating APIs with React and Redux in aviation software?

6-STEPS:

1. setting up the Redux store, 
2. defining actions to trigger API calls, 
3. creating reducers to manage the state based on API responses, 
4. using middleware like Redux Thunk to handle asynchronous operations, and 
5. connecting React components to the Redux store to access and update data from the API; 
6. ensuring proper error handling and loading state management throughout the process. 

8. What experience do you have with Node.js, and how have you used it in conjunction with React for full-stack development?

"When building full-stack applications, I leverage Node.js extensively on the backend to create robust APIs that seamlessly interact 
with my React frontend, allowing for efficient data fetching, real-time updates, and user authentication.

9. How do you approach testing React components and Redux actions/reducers?

React Component Testing: 
Use React Testing Library for component tests.
Test responsive behavior and ensure components function properly across different screen sizes.


Redux Testing:
Use Jest to write tests for Redux actions and reducers

10. Describe your experience with version control and collaborative development using Git.

1. Branching and Merging: Epic branch creation, Create PR(2 approval) we can merge to epic.
2. Collaboration Workflows: peer code reviews
3. Common Commands: init, clone, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, and rebase
4. Troubleshooting: use Git's history and diff tools to track down the source of bugs.

11. How do you stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in React, Redux, and Material UI?

follow official documentation, 
subscribe to blogs and newsletters, 
actively participate in online communities(Stack overflow), 
attend conferences and workshops, 
experiment with new features, and 
regularly update your projects to the latest versions of the libraries. 

12. Can you explain the concept of server-side rendering in React and its benefits for aviation applications?

Server-side rendering (SSR) in React means that instead of rendering a web page entirely on the user's browser, 
the initial HTML content is generated on the server and then sent to the client, resulting in FASTER PAGE LOAD TIMES AND IMPROVED SEO,
which can be particularly beneficial for aviation applications where quick access to critical information is crucial. 

13. How do you handle state management for complex forms in React, especially those common in aviation systems?

 For simple forms, useState or custom hooks may suffice, 
 while more complex scenarios may benefit from useReducer, Context API, or third-party libraries.

14. Describe your experience with implementing real-time updates using React and Redux, which might be crucial for aviation data.

Implementing real-time updates with React and Redux often involves establishing a connection with a backend service using technologies like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE). 
The general approach includes 
setting up the connection, 
dispatching actions to update the Redux store upon receiving new data, and 
connecting React components to the store to reflect these changes in the UI.


15. How do you approach accessibility in your UI designs, considering the diverse user base in the aviation industry?

To approach accessibility in UI design, 
prioritize clear visual hierarchy, 
sufficient color contrast, 
legible fonts, 
proper semantic HTML, 
alternative text for images, 
keyboard navigation, 
focus states, and 
user testing with people with disabilities, 
ensuring all users can interact with the interface regardless of their abilities by following accessibility guidelines like WCAG standards.
