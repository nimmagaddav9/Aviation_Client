Front End Developer Opportunity with Aviation Client


1. Can you describe your experience using React.js for building user interfaces in the aviation sector?

In the past 2 years, I worked on the React migration team, where I converted the .net pages to react on united.com. 
Frontend is React, and used ATMOS (Own library) components used company wide.

Worked on Security features for users where they can manage there account like Forgot password, Forgot MileagePlus number, 
security questions, Sign-in features, Miles-Pooling, United Club pass,  Recent Activity, dashboard updates and 
KTN(Known Traveler Number), Accessibility guidelines features on united.com.

The new initiative worked on Miles-Pooling( points you get after traveling), TSA Precheck, Account security and management features, and Under18.



2. How have you implemented Redux for state management in large-scale React applications?

used middleware such as redux-saga to handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls, data fetching, and impure actions in a more organized and efficient way.


3. What strategies do you use to optimize performance in React applications, particularly for data-heavy aviation systems?

1. Memoization with useMemo and useCallback:  Use this hooks to memoize values and, reducing unnecessary recalculations.
2. Optimizing Renders with React.Fragment: Use it to avoid unnecessary wrapper elements that could cause additional DOM nodes.
3. Lazy loading with React.lazy: Use it to load components lazily, reducing the intial bundle size and improving intial loading performance.
4. Code splitting: Employ code splitting to divide your application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, improving initial load times.
5. Optimizing Images and Assets:  Compress and optimize images, use responsive images and leverage lazy loading for images to reduce network and rendering overhead.


4. Explain how you've used Material UI components to create consistent and responsive designs for aviation-related projects.



5. Describe a challenging UI problem you encountered in an aviation project and how you solved it using React and Redux.

6. How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design in your React applications?

7. Can you walk us through your process for integrating APIs with React and Redux in aviation software?

8. What experience do you have with Node.js, and how have you used it in conjunction with React for full-stack development?

9. How do you approach testing React components and Redux actions/reducers?

10. Describe your experience with version control and collaborative development using Git.

11. How do you stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in React, Redux, and Material UI?

12. Can you explain the concept of server-side rendering in React and its benefits for aviation applications?

13. How do you handle state management for complex forms in React, especially those common in aviation systems?

14. Describe your experience with implementing real-time updates using React and Redux, which might be crucial for aviation data.

15. How do you approach accessibility in your UI designs, considering the diverse user base in the aviation industry?
